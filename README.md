# AtomDevEnv
Atom TRS-80 Color Computer (and varients) development environment scripts, etc..

In order to use this, you will need to install the Atom Editor:
https://atom.io/

In addition, you will need to add the following Atom package:
https://atom.io/packages/atom-shell-commands

Optionally add the Extended Color Basic 2.1 syntax file package:
https://atom.io/packages/language-cocobasic

The Atom development environment also requires some external, supporting applications.  One (or both) of the following emulators:

MAME emulator:
https://www.mamedev.org/

XRoar emulator:
https://www.6809.org.uk/xroar/

Motorola 6809 dev tools:
https://launchpad.net/~tormodvolden/+archive/ubuntu/m6809

If you wish to do C development, you will need CMOC:
https://perso.b2b2c.ca/~sarrazip/dev/cmoc.html

If you wish to do assembly programming, you will need one (or both) of these assemblers:

LWASM (as part of LWTOOLS):
http://www.lwtools.ca/

ASM6809:
https://www.6809.org.uk/asm6809/

For Drivewire based support, I recommend Michael Fuhrman's pyDriveWire:
